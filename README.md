# python-challenge
I cried 3 times doing this homework
But I've learnt quite a bit, especially how to work with for loops in Python

Pybank is all about using for loops and assigning a list into a colunm

PyPoll is a bit more challanging with a bigger data set and I had to created dictionaries on top of using for loops and lists. 

There is no way that I can finish these 2 homeworks without the help from BCS assistant (Shout out to Zubair, you saved my life, big time) and my tutor.

Overall it is a quite challenging homework compared to the previous ones, but I'm glad that I made it through.
